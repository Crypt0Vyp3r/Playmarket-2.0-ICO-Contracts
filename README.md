# ISSUE AND DISTRIBUTION OF TOKENS

Ticker token DAO PlayMarket 2.0 - PMT.
The PMT standard is ERC20.
The number of PMT is 3,000,000
In the ICO process, it is planned to distribute 
50%, and the attracted funds will be sent 
to the marketing program to promote 
the PlayMarket 2.0 platform. Tokens will be 
sold in five stages, and we predict that their 
price from the beginning to the end of the ICO 
will grow several times.
At each stage of the ICO a discount is given 
depending on the stage and the total amount 
of the purchase. (in the case of two transactions 
of 10 ETH, a discount is not provided, and when 
buying for the amount of 10.1 ETH - a discount 
of 25%). The number of distributed tokens at 
each stage will be 450 thousand pieces, and the 
stage continues until their full sale. 
PlayMarket 2.0 tokens can be purchased for 
crypto currency: BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, DASH 
All collected funds will be guaranteed to be 
deposited into the account and will be stored 
on wallets with multi-signatures.
The remaining 25% of the PMT will be 
transferred to the project team that acts as the 
organizer of DAO PlayMarket 2.0 and this PMT 
will be frozen for 24 months.


Important notes:
 1. PMT will be sent automatically back to the wallet from which the funds have been sent.
 2. PMT transactions will be limited till ICO end to prevent trading before the ICO ends.
 3. During the ICO ETH is accepted only from wallets compliant with ERC-20 token standard. (recommended to use: MyEtherWallet). Do not send ETH directly from cryptocurrency exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Poloniex etc.)!
